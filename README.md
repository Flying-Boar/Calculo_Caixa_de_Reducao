# Code implementation in OCTAVE software for reduction box sizing.

> Speed ​​reducer, with the selection of a three-phase 2-pole induction motor operating at 3380 RPM and 1.5 kW (2.0 hp) from the WEG brand, IP55, the objective is to “transform” the rotation through the use of the reducer of input and torque, in another rotation and final torque required, for this project, we have an input of 3380 RPM and we need a conversion to 200 N.m of torque at the final output of the speed reducer.

> This work proposes the design of a speed reducer with the function of enabling an evaluation instrument for the Machine Elements discipline, at the Federal Institute of São Paulo, São João da Boa Vista campus. For the speed reducer, the entire the theoretical project using appropriate concepts demonstrated in class by the advisor, by combining concepts, and with theoretical application thoughts. In order to meet the speed and torque demands, it was decided to use a reduction with two pairs of gears and three staggered axles depending on the forces encountered. The concepts and requirements of the project are essential for the adaptive purposes of the participants, aiming to include technologies used in the area of ​​computational calculation, through software such as Matlab and Octave that provide computational mathematical modeling, enabling the understanding of general applications of the theorems and formulas presented.
